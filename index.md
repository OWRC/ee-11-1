# Importance/Relevance of Monitoring Site

The monitoring wells at this site were installed in 1993 and provide access for long-term measurements of groundwater level fluctuations and chemistry for the shallow system (water table within Halton Till) and the deep groundwater flow system (Thorncliffe aquifer complex) near regional groundwater discharge zones;

This site also provides monitoring information for the Lower Newmarket till which controls flow between the shallow and deep parts of the groundwater flow system; and

Observations made at this location continue to provide vital data that has led to an understanding of how groundwater flows in this area, an area characterized by a thick lower permeability glacial till unit in the subsurface. 

# Background

The Duffins Creek watershed area has historically been part of many regional geologic and hydrogeologic investigations (Caley et al., 1947; Gadd, 1950; Hainstock et al., 1952; Karrow, 1967; Sibul et al., 1977; Ostry, 1979; Boyce, 1997; Gerber, 1999; Gerber and Howard, 2000; 2002; Li et al., 2008; Meriano and Eyles, 2009).  The southern part of the watershed is the site of two now closed municipal waste landfills, and has seen numerous geological and hydrogeological investigations that were designed to assist in the siting of additional proposed landfill sites.  During the early 1990s the Ontario Provincial Government set up the Interim Waste Authority (IWA) to site a landfill in each of Peel, Durham and York Regions.  Some of the locations investigated within the north Pickering area, including Site EE11, are shown on Figure 1.  Further information regarding the proposed IWA landfill sites shown on Figure 1 can be found in IWA, 1994a-e.  The location of this site is also shown on Figure 2 and the regional geologic context is provided on the cross section included as Figure 3. 

Groundwater measurements at the site were collected initially by M.M. Dillon Limited during 1993 and 1994 for IWA landfill siting investigations.  Observations were continued by University of Toronto students and staff from 1996 to 2002.  Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (two PGMN piezometers) and ORMGP staff have been collecting measurements from this site since 2009.  Details regarding the seven monitoring wells installed on site are shown on Figure 4.  Manual water level measurements are plotted since 1993 on a hydrograph that can be accessed below (see Documents).
